# SortedÂ³ - Take Home Challenge

## Introduction

Apple introduced an exciting set of features with CoreML in 2019. It makes machine learning approachable to everyone. With CreateML, we can now customize a pre-trained model to fit our needs. Furthermore, CoreML provides the capability to personalize each one's experience on device.

A good example would be the use of Face ID. It learns about your face over time and refines its model on device, without ever sending the data to server for processing. This ensures both privacy and efficiency.
